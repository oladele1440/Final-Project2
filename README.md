# Final-Project
Brief History

Starbucks is a place of worship for coffee growers. It is a chain of cafeterias-coffee shops, with more than 17,000 establishments spread over 49 countries. Some people go through the cities looking for their logo to sit on a sofa and browse their Wi-Fi enjoying a great cup of coffee.

However, its logo has not always been as we know it and, in fact, it has undergone great changes since its creation in 1971. In fact, those who only know the modern logo and have surely wondered who this woman is, and what she has in hands, 

History has the explanation for this mystery

ABOUT THE PROJECT



This Project is set to Determine How Starbucks Coffee company is been distributed in the United States of America and Globally.  

It also going to show the  Relationship between Store owners and the Population Demographics. 

The Project also determine how Weather (Climatic Impact)  Affect sales where the Starbucks Stores are located. 

MACHINE LEARNING – 

In this Project I was able to Merge three(3) Datasets together in other to be able to get an output. So I merged the Starbucks Datasets and also the Census tracts Dataset joined on Postcodes. Trying to Determine all other Coffee Shop located near Starbucks in the USA I was able to use google API to generate the Data of nearby coffee shop around but couldn’t get an accurate result which I tried everything to get it right but few shops showed up.

PURPOSE – To Predict Starbucks Coffee Shops in the US Based on People’s House Hold Income, Income Per Capita, Population and Median Age.

METHOD -  After Several Attempts to Predict, Train and Test the Data that I used I was getting a several Low Test, Train results until I was able to Convert a  column from the Data frame which is the Starbucks Store column to bins (Binary numbers) and Substituted to (y)
I was able to use Random Forest Analysis, Confusion Matrix, Mean Squared Error(MSE) and K_Nearest_Neighbor(KNN) to Test , Train and Predict the Data.
